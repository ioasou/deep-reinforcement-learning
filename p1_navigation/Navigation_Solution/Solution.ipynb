    "The objective of this project is to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent to navigate (and collect bananas) in a large, square enviroment. The enviroment has been prepared by the Udacity team and is similar to, but not identical to Banana Collector enviroment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector).\n",

    "A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana. The state space has `37` dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. The state space corresponds to 35 dimensions of ray-based perception of objects around the agent’s forward direction and 2 dimensions of velocity. The 35 dimensions of ray perception are broken down as: 7 rays projecting from the agent at the following angles (and returned back in the same order): [20, 90, 160, 45, 135, 70, 110] where 90 is directly in front of the agent. Each ray is 5 dimensional and it projected onto the scene. If it encounters one of four detectable objects (i.e. yellow banana, wall, blue banana, agent), the value at that position in the array is set to 1. Finally there is a distance measure which is a fraction of the ray length. Each ray is [Yellow Banana, Wall, Blue Banana, Agent, Distance]. For example, [0,1,1,0,0,0.2] means that there is a blue banana detected 20% of the distance along the ray with a wall behind it. The velocity of the agent is two dimensional: left/right velocity (usually near 0) and forward/backward velocity (0 to 11.2). Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. \n",

    "The main idea behind the Q-Learning is that we if we had an action-value function that could tell us what our retun would be, if we were to take an action in a given state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our rewards. However, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have access to the action-value function Q(s,a). But, since neural networks are universal function approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble the action-value function Q(s,a). For our training update rule, we'll use a fact that every Q(s,a) function for some policy obeys the [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation).\n",

    "Additionally we will be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes and improves the DQN training procedure."
